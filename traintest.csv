2	Do you find that the higher up in the company you are the less you work and the more you spend on the net? There are so many intelligent professional people on QL; that it makes me wonder how any work is done in Qatar.  (btw I'm not talking about myself; the only reason I'm on QL so much is because our Doha office is not ready!   I'm at the bottom of this food chain!)

0	Today at the Souks (sp?) I was ""pinched"" by several Qatari men (dressed in thwob). Of course; they could have been of different nationality; I am just assuming they were Qatari.

0	My family and I are new here. I packed lightly for my stay; with the intent to purchase a burqa for my outings; out of respect for the culture. However; I am surprised to find so many women not wearing them. Is there a need as long as I am dressed conservatively; or are those not wearing them being disrespectful and simply tolerated?
2	Since we all came from a woman; got our name from a woman; and our game from a woman. I wonder why we take from woman; why we rape our woman; do we hate our woman? I think its time we killed for our woman; be real to our woman; try to heal our woman; cus if we dont we'll have a race of babies that will hate the ladies; who make the babies. And since a man can't make one he has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one. ~ Tupac Shakur
